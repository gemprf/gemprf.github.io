    "text": "Configuration - GEM-pRF | XML Configuration Guide GEM-pRF Configuration Quick Overview ⚙️ GEM-pRF uses a simple XML configuration file. 📄 All analysis settings, paths, and parameters live inside this file. 🚀 Your Python code stays tiny, you only call gp.run(CONFIG_FILEPATH) . 🔁 Create multiple XML files to run multiple analyses easily. 📂 GEM-pRF stores a copy of your XML file inside the analysis output folder. ⚡ Use Configuration Generator to create XML files through an interactive web interface. 💾 Download a sample config file to get started quickly. The configuration file is the heart of GEM-pRF . If the XML file is correct, GEM-pRF will run smoothly - no code changes needed. Why an XML configuration file? GEM-pRF keeps analysis settings separate from the code. Instead of editing Python scripts, you adjust the XML — flexible,simple, safe, and easy to automate. No code editing: all parameters are defined in the XML. Batch processing: create multiple config files and run them in sequence. Automation: call gp.run() in a loop or run a bash script over a folder of XML files. Reproducibility: GEM-pRF automatically saves the XML file inside the analysis output directory. Clarity: well-named XML files make it easy to track analyses. Recommended naming conventions While not required, giving your XML files meaningful names makes your work much easier to understand later. A BIDS-style naming convention works very well. study-CHN_task-fixedbar123_run-concat_analysis-02_desc-hres.xml Clear naming helps you recognize what the analysis did even years later. How to run GEM-pRF using a config file Once gemprf and the matching CuPy build are installed, run GEM-pRF using: import gemprf as gp gp.run(\"path/to/your_config.xml\") GEM-pRF reads everything from the XML file — data paths, stimuli, parameters, output locations — and executes the full analysis automatically. Where to edit the XML file Use an editor that highlights XML tags clearly, so you can avoid small mistakes and see the structure of the configuration file at a glance. VS Code (recommended, easy to use and has great XML highlighting) Notepad++ (lightweight and works well on Windows systems) Sublime Text, Atom, or any editor that provides XML syntax coloring and indentation support See a full configuration example A complete example configuration file is available on GitHub: Use this example as a template and adjust paths and parameters for your study.

Download from PyPI (recommended) The easiest and most common way to install GEM-pRF is directly from PyPI: pip install gemprf The latest release is available here: PyPI – gemprf . After installation, see Running for instructions on running GEM-pRF. 2. Source Code This option is useful for contributors or advanced users who want to inspect the implementation, debug, or modify the code. For most users, installing from PyPI is the recommended and simplest method. 3. Sample Configuration File Once you have GEM-pRF installed, you'll need a configuration file to run your analysis. A sample configuration file is provided below to give you a sense of how GEM-pRF configurations work. Don't worry if it looks intimidating at first! XML configuration files are actually quite straightforward once you understand the basic structure. Most settings are well-commented, and you only need to modify a few key parameters for your analysis.

Make sure your system has a compatible GPU available. ⚠️ Ensure your system has a compatible NVIDIA GPU available. Step 1. Create a new python environment (recommended) Create a fresh conda environment: conda create --name gemprf python=3.10 conda activate gemprf Step 2. Set up GPU environment Install the CUDA SDK . Check your CUDA installation: nvcc --version nvidia-smi Install a CuPy build that matches your CUDA version: pip install cupy-cuda12x # Replace 12x with your CUDA version Step 3. Verify CUDA–CuPy compatibility Run a quick test to confirm CuPy can use the CUDA runtime correctly: python -c \"import cupy as cp; print(cp.arange(5) ** 2)\" If this fails, your CuPy build does not match your CUDA runtime. Step 4. Install GEM-pRF via pip Install from PyPI: pip install gemprf Latest releases: PyPI – gemprf Step 5. Try the GEMpRF-DemoKit (optional) Follow the instructions in the Getting Started with GEMpRF-DemoKit tutorial to verify your installation. ✅ Once installed, proceed to Running GEM-pRF ."

    "text": "Grid Fit vs Grid + Refine Fit - GEM-pRF | Fitting Strategy Tutorial > GEM-pRF Grid Fit vs Grid + Refine Fit One of the key decisions in configuring GEM-pRF is choosing your fitting strategy. GEM-pRF offers two approaches to estimating population receptive fields: grid fitting only or a two-stage approach combining grid fitting with refine fitting . This choice significantly impacts both the speed and accuracy of your analysis. Quick Overview ⚙️ Grid Fitting: Fast initial parameter search across a defined space 🔧 Refine Fitting: Optional fine-tuning for improved accuracy (little slower) 📋 Configure via your XML configuration file ⚡ Choose based on your accuracy vs. speed requirements 🎯 Two-stage approach is recommended for most analyses Grid Fitting Grid fitting is the initial stage where GEM-pRF searches across a coarse grid of population receptive field parameters. This stage efficiently explores the parameter space and produces reasonable initial estimates for each voxel. Characteristics of Grid Fitting: Speed: Fast, suitable for large-scale analyses Coverage: Explores the full parameter space systematically Accuracy: Good estimates, but may not capture fine details Use Case: Quick exploratory analyses or when computational resources are limited Refine Fitting Refine fitting (also called fine-fit) is an optional second stage that takes the results from grid fitting and performs a more precise optimization around the best grid solution. This can significantly improve parameter estimates. For detailed information about the gridfit and refinefit algorithms, see the GEM-pRF research paper . Characteristics of Refine Fitting: Speed: Slower than grid fitting alone, but focuses on smaller search space Accuracy: Higher quality parameter estimates with better convergence Optimization: Uses gradient-based methods around the grid solution Use Case: Final, publication-quality analyses Comparing the Two Approaches Aspect Grid Fit Only Grid Fit + Refine Fit Speed Fastest Slower (but still efficient) * Accuracy Good initial estimates Excellent refined estimates * Best For Exploratory analysis, prototyping Publication-quality analysis Parameter Quality Coarse resolution Fine resolution How to Configure Your Fitting Strategy Your choice of fitting strategy is configured through your GEM-pRF XML configuration file. The configuration file controls whether refine fitting is enabled or disabled. XML Configuration Parameters <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?> <root> <!-- Enable both grid fit and refine fit (recommended) --> <refine_fitting enable=\"True\" refinefit_on_gpu=\"True\"/> <!-- REST OF YOUR CONFIGURATION... --> </root> Parameter Values Description enable True / False Enable or disable refine fitting stage refinefit_on_gpu True / False Run refine fitting on GPU (recommended) or CPU (if memory-limited) Recommendations 💡 For Most Users: We recommend using grid fitting combined with refine fitting (the two-stage approach) for your final analyses. The extra computation time is well worth the improvement in parameter quality, and GEM-pRF's GPU acceleration makes this quite fast even for large datasets. ⚡ For Quick Exploration: If you're testing configurations or doing preliminary analysis, grid fitting alone is sufficient and much faster. You can always switch to the two-stage approach later. Next Steps Try it out: Get started quickly with the GEM-pRF DemoKit , which includes example datasets and configuration files you can experiment with Learn about configuration: Read the Configuration File Tutorial to understand all available options Start with a sample: Use the sample configuration file as a template and modify the fitting strategy to match your needs Monitor performance: Compare the analysis time and result quality between the two approaches to inform your choice for future analyses 📚 Learn More: For complete details about configuration options and fitting parameters, see the Configuration File Tutorial ."
