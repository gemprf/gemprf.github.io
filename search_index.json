    "text": "Configuration - GEM-pRF GEM-pRF Configuration Quick Overview ⚙️ GEM-pRF uses a simple XML configuration file. 📄 All analysis settings, paths, and parameters live inside this file. 🚀 Your Python code stays tiny, you only call gp.run(CONFIG_FILEPATH) . 🔁 Create multiple XML files to run multiple analyses easily. 📂 GEM-pRF stores a copy of your XML file inside the analysis output folder. The configuration file is the heart of GEM-pRF . If the XML file is correct, GEM-pRF will run smoothly — no code changes needed. Why an XML configuration file? GEM-pRF keeps analysis settings separate from the code. Instead of editing Python scripts, you adjust the XML — flexible,simple, safe, and easy to automate. No code editing: all parameters are defined in the XML. Batch processing: create multiple config files and run them in sequence. Automation: call gp.run() in a loop or run a bash script over a folder of XML files. Reproducibility: GEM-pRF automatically saves the XML file inside the analysis output directory. Clarity: well-named XML files make it easy to track analyses. Recommended naming conventions While not required, giving your XML files meaningful names makes your work much easier to understand later. A BIDS-style naming convention works very well. study-CHN_task-fixedbar123_run-concat_analysis-02_desc-hres.xml Clear naming helps you recognize what the analysis did even years later. How to run GEM-pRF using a config file Once gemprf and the matching CuPy build are installed, run GEM-pRF using: import gemprf as gp gp.run(\"path/to/your_config.xml\") GEM-pRF reads everything from the XML file — data paths, stimuli, parameters, output locations — and executes the full analysis automatically. Where to edit the XML file Use an editor that highlights XML tags clearly, so you can avoid small mistakes and see the structure of the configuration file at a glance. VS Code (recommended, easy to use and has great XML highlighting) Notepad++ (lightweight and works well on Windows systems) Sublime Text, Atom, or any editor that provides XML syntax coloring and indentation support See a full configuration example A complete example configuration file is available here: 👉 Configuration File Example Use it as a template, adjust paths and parameters, and you're ready to run GEM-pRF."

    "text": "Download GEM-pRF GEM-pRF Download GEM-pRF GEM-pRF can be downloaded in two ways, depending on your access and workflow. 1. Download from PyPI (recommended) The easiest and most common way to install GEM-pRF is directly from PyPI: pip install gemprf The latest release is available here: PyPI – gemprf . After installation, see Running for instructions on running GEM-pRF. 2. Download from GitHub (restricted access) Users who have been granted access to the private GEM-pRF GitHub repository may also download the source code directly from there. This option is mainly for contributors or advanced users who want to inspect the implementation, debug, or modify the code. For most users, installing from PyPI is the recommended and simplest method."

Make sure your system has a compatible GPU available. ⚠️ Ensure your system has a compatible NVIDIA GPU available. Step 1. Create a new python environment (recommended) Create a fresh conda environment: conda create --name gemprf python=3.10 conda activate gemprf Step 2. Set up GPU environment Install the CUDA SDK . Check your CUDA installation: nvcc --version nvidia-smi Install a CuPy build that matches your CUDA version: pip install cupy-cuda12x # Replace 12x with your CUDA version Step 3. Verify CUDA–CuPy compatibility Run a quick test to confirm CuPy can use the CUDA runtime correctly: python -c \"import cupy as cp; print(cp.arange(5) ** 2)\" If this fails, your CuPy build does not match your CUDA runtime. Step 4. Install GEM-pRF via pip Install from PyPI: pip install gemprf Latest releases: PyPI – gemprf Step 5. Try the GEMpRF-DemoKit (optional) Follow the instructions in the Getting Started with GEMpRF-DemoKit tutorial to verify your installation. ✅ Once installed, proceed to Running GEM-pRF ."

Step-by-Step Guide Option A: Run GEM-pRF from Python (recommended) This is the simplest way to use GEM-pRF. No cloning, no manual entry points. Import the package: import gemprf as gp Run GEM-pRF by providing the path to your XML config file ( see a sample config here ): import gemprf as gp gp.run(\"path/to/your_config.xml\") This works in any Python environment: scripts, Jupyter, VS Code, PyCharm — everything. Option B: Advanced — Run from entry script (GitHub codebase) For users with full access to the GEM-pRF source code (e.g. debugging, modifying kernels), you can execute GEM from its terminal entry point. Activate your environment and navigate to the GEMpRF folder. Run: python run_gem.py PATH_TO_YOUR_XML_CONFIG_FILE Option C: Run from an IDE (source-code users) Open the GEM-pRF code folder in VS Code or PyCharm. Edit run_gem.py to point to your XML config file. Execute the script directly inside the IDE."

What happens during the demo Interactive menu : choose examples showing different input styles Automatic path fixing : XML configs update to your local DemoKit paths GPU memory check : prevents running models that won’t fit Full GEM-pRF run : executes gp.run() using the selected configuration How Input Sources Work GEM-pRF accepts inputs from multiple sources: raw filesystem paths or structured BIDS datasets. Everything is controlled through XML configuration files, not by modifying GEM-pRF code. Filesystem paths : direct references to your fMRI and stimulus files BIDS datasets : GEM-pRF locates the correct files based on subject/session Examples You Will See (001–005) 001: BIDS + prfprepare (surface), individual runs 002: BIDS + fMRIPrep (surface), individual runs 003: BIDS + fMRIPrep (volume), individual runs 004: BIDS + fMRIPrep (surface + volume), individual runs 005: Fixed paths (non-BIDS) + prfprepare (surface) Notes Ensure GEM-pRF and required dependencies (e.g., CuPy for GPU support) are installed. When adapting examples to your own data, check the XML comments to see which fields control input behaviour."
